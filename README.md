# CS-106A

Tom McDonough's completed homework and tests for Stanford's CS-106A class (offered via Stanford Engineering Everywhere)

I have no formal training in programming, though I had been able to pick up enough Python to scrape websites.
After looking at some code I had written about a year prior to starting this class, I recognized that my code was un-readable.
So, I decided it would make sense to start utilizing some of the resources available online to become a better programmer.
Stanford's CS 106-A and 106-B seemed like a great place to start - intro level CS from one of the best institutions in the country,
conveniently located in the heart of the tech scene. In addition, after the completion of these courses I will have satisfied the
pre-requisite for CS 103-A, which I ultimately hope to take, followed by several of the "foundation courses" in Stanford's
CS Master's program.

This repository serves a few purposes:

1) Accountability. Making my work public forces me to put at least somewhat more thought that I might otherwise; seeing my old 
   code was fairly embarrasing. It is my hope that, as a result, I will build readable, top-down code with understandable
   comments throughout.
2) Proof. In the event that I ever need evidence that I completed this course, I hope that this repository will help. I also 
   plan on watching the lectures through iTunes U (rather than YouTube), as further proof.
3) Sunk-cost Fallacy. I've taken a few MOOCs in the past; while I'm not proud to admit it, I did not see all 
   of them through to completion. A full-time job and the pursuit of a CFA designation will do that. Hopefully the process of 
   making a repository - that is, turning this class into a more-tangible *thing* - will cause me to stick with it.
